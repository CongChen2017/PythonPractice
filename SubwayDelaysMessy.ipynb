    "\n",
    "* In this activity, you will use data gathered from Twitter to plot which trains in the NYC subway system most frequently cause delays.\n",
    "\n",
    "* The Twitter account **SubwayStats** announces delays and changes in the NYC subway system.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Your goal is to pull the 1,000 most recent tweets from that account and use MatPlotLib to generate a bar chart of the number of delays per each train:\n",
    "\n",
    "  ![subway.png](subway.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "* Accomplish this task by first compiling a Python dictionary, whose key value pairs consist of each train and the number of delays:\n",
    "\n",
    "  ![subway1.png](subway1.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "* In order to build such a dictionary, you will need to filter the tweet texts.\n",
    "\n",
    "* See the Jupyter Notebook file for more specific instructions at each step. Good luck!"
